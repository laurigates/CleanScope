    USB Device Filter for UVC (USB Video Class) devices

    UVC devices use class 0x0E (14 decimal) as defined in the USB specification.
    This filter matches any USB device that identifies as a video device,
    which includes most endoscopes and USB cameras.

    The empty <usb-device /> tag acts as a catch-all for any USB device,
    which is useful for development. For production, you may want to
    restrict to specific vendor/product IDs or use the class filter below.
    -->

    <!-- Catch-all: matches any USB device (development mode) -->
    <usb-device />

    <!--
    Alternative: Match only UVC (USB Video Class) devices
    Uncomment the line below and comment out the catch-all above for production
    -->
    <!-- <usb-device class="14" /> -->

    <!--
    For specific endoscope models, you can add vendor/product ID filters:
    <usb-device vendor-id="1234" product-id="5678" />

    Common endoscope vendor IDs (in decimal):
    - Depstech: 1443 (0x05A3)
    - Teslong: 1443 (0x05A3)
    - Generic UVC: varies
