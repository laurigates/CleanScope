<!-- USB device filter for CleanScope
     This file specifies which USB devices should trigger auto-launch.

     UVC (USB Video Class) devices use:
     - Class: 239 (0xEF) - Miscellaneous (for composite devices)
     - Class: 14 (0x0E) - Video class

     Common USB endoscope vendor IDs:
     - Many cheap endoscopes use generic chipsets without unique vendor IDs
     - The class-based filter below catches most UVC cameras
-->
<resources>
    <!-- Match any UVC Video device (class 14 = 0x0E) -->
    <usb-device class="14" />

    <!-- Match miscellaneous class devices (class 239 = 0xEF)
         Some composite UVC devices present as this class -->
    <usb-device class="239" subclass="2" />

    <!-- Common endoscope chipsets - add specific IDs if needed -->
    <!-- Example: <usb-device vendor-id="1234" product-id="5678" /> -->
